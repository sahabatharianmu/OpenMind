# Contributing to OpenMind

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to OpenMind.

## 📜 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Per our license strategy, we require all contributors to sign a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**.
This ensures that we (the project owners) have the legal right to relicense contributions if necessary (e.g., for a commercial cloud version) while you retain copyright over your code.

**If you open a Pull Request, a bot will ask you to sign the CLA.** It’s easy—just click a button/link to accept.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Linting**: Ensure your code passes linting (`bun run lint` in web, `golangci-lint` in root).
3.  **Tests**: Write tests for new features.
4.  **Pull Request**: Open a PR to `main`.

## 🧪 Development Setup

Please refer to the "Local Development" section in the [README](README.md).
